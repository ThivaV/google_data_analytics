## Learning about data phases and tools

* Stages of the **data life cycle**
    1. **Plan:** Decide what kind of data is needed, how it will be managed, and who will be responsible for it.
    1. **Capture:** Collect or bring in data from a variety of different sources.
    1. **Manage:** Care for and maintain the data. This includes determining how and where it is stored and the tools used to do so.
    1. **Analyze:** Use the data to solve problems, make decisions, and support business goals.
    1. **Archive:** Keep relevant data stored for long-term and future reference.
    1. **Destroy:** Remove data from storage and delete any shared copies of the data.

    * **Example Usecases:**
        * **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service**
            * The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses the following data life cycle:
                1. Plan
                1. Acquire
                1. Maintain
                1. Access
                1. Evaluate
                1. Archive
                
            For more information, refer to [U.S. Fish and Wildlife's Data Management Life Cycle](https://www.fws.gov/data/life-cycle) page.
        * **The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)**
            * The USGS uses the data life cycle below:
                1. Plan
                1. Acquire
                1. Process
                1. Analyze
                1. Preserve
                1. Publish/Share
            Several cross-cutting or overarching activities are also performed during each stage of their life cycle:
                * Describe (metadata and documentation)
                * Manage Quality
                * Backup and Secure

            For more information, refer to the [USGS Data Lifecycle](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management/data-lifecycle) page.

        * **Financial institutions**
            * Financial institutions may take a slightly different approach to the data life cycle as described in The [Data Life Cycle](https://sfmagazine.com/post-entry/july-2018-the-data-life-cycle/), an article in Strategic Finance magazine:
                1. Capture
                1. Qualify
                1. Transform
                1. Utilize
                1. Report
                1. Archive
                1. Purge 
        * **Harvard Business School (HBS)**
            * One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight stages:
                1. Generation
                1. Collection
                1. Processing
                1. Storage 
                1. Management
                1. Analysis
                1. Visualization
                1. Interpretation
            For more information, refer to [8 Steps in the Data Life Cycle](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-life-cycle).

    * True
* During which phase of data analysis would a data analyst use spreadsheets or query languages to transform data in order to draw conclusions?
    * Analyze
* In which data analysis phase would a data analyst use visuals such as charts or graphs to simplify complex data for better understanding?
    * Share
* A data analyst shares insights from their analysis during a formal presentation to stakeholders. In a slideshow, they make a data-driven recommendation for how to solve a business problem. What phase of the data analysis process would come next?

## Data analyst tools

* As you are learning, the most common programs and solutions used by data analysts include spreadsheets, query languages, and visualization tools. In this reading, you will learn more about each one. You will cover when to use them, and why they are so important in data analytics.

* Spreadsheets:
    * Data analysts rely on spreadsheets to collect and organize data. Two popular spreadsheet applications you will probably use a lot in your future role as a data analyst are Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
    * Spreadsheets structure data in a meaningful way by letting you:
        * Collect, store, organize, and sort information
        * Identify patterns and piece the data together in a way that works for each specific data project
        * Create excellent data visualizations, like graphs and charts.

* Databases and query languages:
    * A database is a collection of structured data stored in a computer system. Some popular Structured Query Language (SQL) programs include MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and BigQuery.
    * Query languages:
        * Allow analysts to isolate specific information from a database(s)
        * Make it easier for you to learn and understand the requests made to databases
        * Allow analysts to select, create, add, or download data from a database for analysis

* Visualization tools:
    * Data analysts use a number of visualization tools, like graphs, maps, tables, charts, and more. Two popular visualization tools are Tableau and Looker.
    * These tools:
        * Turn complex numbers into a story that people can understand
        * Help stakeholders come up with conclusions that lead to informed decisions and effective business strategies
        * Have multiple features:
            * **Tableau**'s simple drag-and-drop feature lets users create interactive graphs in dashboards and worksheets
            * **Looker** communicates directly with a database, allowing you to connect your data right to the visual tool you choose

* What is the relationship between the data life cycle and the data analysis process? How are the two processes similar? How are they different?

* What is the relationship between the Ask phase of the data analysis process and the Plan phase of the data life cycle? How are they similar? How are they different?
