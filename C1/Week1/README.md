## Case Study: New data perspectives

* A real-life example of how one group of data analysts used the six steps of the data analysis process to improve their workplace and its business processes. Their story involves something called people analytics — also known as human resources analytics or workforce analytics. People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company’s workforce in order to gain insights to improve how the company operates.

* Being a people analyst involves using data analysis to gain insights about employees and how they experience their work lives. The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture.

* The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**. These six steps apply to any data analysis. Continue reading to learn how a team of people analysts used these six steps to answer a business question.
    1. Ask
    1. Prepare
    1. Process
    1. Analysis
    1. Share
    1. Act

* An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: how can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?

    > Here is a break down of what this team did, step by step.

    * **Ask**
        - First up, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. So, to determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis. These were the kinds of questions they asked:
            - What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job?
            - Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?
            - Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
            - What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
            - By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?
    * **Prepare**
        - It all started with solid **preparation**. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from an online survey of new employees. These were the things they did to prepare:
            - They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and their overall compensation.
            - They established rules for who would have access to the data collected - in this case, anyone outside the group wouldn't have access to the raw data, but could view summarized or aggregated data. For example, an individual's compensation wouldn't be available, but salary ranges for groups of individuals would be viewable.
            - They finalized what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them. 
    * **Process**
        - The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be **collected, stored, managed, and protected**. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, these were the steps they took:
            - They restricted access to the data to a limited number of analysts.
            - They cleaned the data to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant. Certain data was aggregated and summarized without revealing individual responses.
            - They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.  
    * **Analysis**
        - Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts discovered that an employee’s experience with certain processes was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. These were their findings:
            - Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company.
            - Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company.
        - The group knew it was important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would diminish trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future. 
    * **Share**
        - Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful **sharing the report**. This is how they shared their findings:
            - They shared the report with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports with submitted responses to the survey.
            - They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture. 
            - They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams.
        - This process gave managers an opportunity to **communicate the results** with the right context. As a result, they could have productive team conversations about next steps to improve employee engagement.  
    * **Act**
        - The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to **implement changes and take actions** based on the findings. These were their recommendations:
            - Standardize the hiring and evaluation process for employees based on the most efficient and transparent practices.
            - Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year.

## Data Ecosystem

* Data ecosystem: The various elements that interacts with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analysis, and share data.

* **Data-driven decision-making**: Using facts to guide business strategy

## Data and gut instinct

* Detectives and data analysts have a lot in common. Both depend on facts and clues to make decisions. Both collect and look at the evidence. Both talk to people who know part of the story. And both might even follow some footprints to see where they lead. Whether you’re a detective or a data analyst, your job is all about following steps to collect and understand facts.

* Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:
    1. **Ask** questions and define the problem.
    1. **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.
    1. **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.
    1. **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
    1. **Share** data with your audience.
    1. **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

But there are other factors that influence the decision-making process. You may have read mysteries where the detective used their gut instinct, and followed a hunch that helped them solve the case. **Gut instinct** is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation. This isn’t always something conscious; we often pick up on signals without even realizing. You just have a “feeling” it’s right.

### Why gut instinct can be a problem

At the heart of data-driven decision making is data. Therefore, it's essential that data analysts focus on the data to ensure they make informed decisions. If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be biased. But even worse, decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes. 

Consider an example of a real estate developer bidding to redevelop a part of a city's central district. They were well-known for preservation of historical buildings. Banking on their reputation, the agency's planners followed gut instinct and included the preservation of several buildings to gain support and win approval for the project. However, private donations fell short and a partnership failed to materialize and save the day. The buildings eventually had to be torn down after much delay and an expensive dispute with the city.   

The more you understand the data related to a project, the easier it will be to figure out what is required. These efforts will also help you identify errors and gaps in your data so you can communicate your findings more effectively. Sometimes past experience helps you make a connection that no one else would notice. For example, a detective might be able to crack open a case because they remember an old case just like the one they’re solving today. It's not just gut instinct.

### Data + business knowledge = mystery solved

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst. The key is figuring out the exact mix for each particular project. A lot of times, it will depend on the goals of your analysis. That is why analysts often ask, “How do I define success for this project?”

In addition, try asking yourself these questions about a project to help find the perfect balance:

* What kind of results are needed?
* Who will be informed?
* Am I answering the question being asked?
* How quickly does a decision need to be made?

For instance, if you are working on a rush project, you might need to rely on your own knowledge and experience more than usual. There just isn’t enough time to thoroughly analyze all of the available data. But if you get a project that involves plenty of time and resources, then the best strategy is to be more data-driven. It’s up to you, the data analyst, to make the best possible choice. You will probably blend data and knowledge a million different ways over the course of your data analytics career. And the more you practice, the better you will get at finding that perfect blend.

## Origins of the data analysis process

When you decided to join this program, you proved that you are a curious person. So let’s tap into your curiosity and talk about the origins of data analysis. We don’t fully know when or why the first person decided to record data about people and things. But we do know it was useful because the idea is still around today!.

We also know that data analysis is rooted in statistics, which has a pretty long history itself. Archaeologists mark the start of statistics in ancient Egypt with the building of the pyramids. The ancient Egyptians were masters of organizing data. They documented their calculations and theories on papyri (paper-like materials), which are now viewed as the earliest examples of spreadsheets and checklists. Today’s data analysts owe a lot to those brilliant scribes, who helped create a more technical and efficient process.

It is time to enter the **data analysis life cycle**—the process of going from data to decision. Data goes through several phases as it gets created, consumed, tested, processed, and reused. With a life cycle model, all key team members can drive success by planning work both up front and at the end of the data analysis process. While the data analysis life cycle is well known among experts, there isn't a single defined structure of those phases. There might not be one single architecture that’s uniformly followed by every data analysis expert, but there are some shared fundamentals in every data analysis process. This reading provides an overview of several, starting with the process that forms the foundation of the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:

1. **Ask:** Business Challenge/Objective/Question
1. **Prepare:** Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
1. **Process:** Data cleaning/data integrity
1. **Analyze:** Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
1. **Share:** Communicating and interpreting results
1. **Act:**  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

Understanding this process—and all of the iterations that helped make it popular—will be a big part of guiding your own analysis and your work in this program. Let’s go over a few other variations of the data analysis life cycle.

### EMC's data analysis life cycle

EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:

1. Discovery
1. Pre-processing data
1. Model planning
1. Model building
1. Communicate results
1. Operationalize

EMC Corporation is now Dell EMC. This model, created by David Dietrich, reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. The phases aren’t static milestones; each step connects and leads to the next, and eventually repeats. Key questions help analysts test whether they have accomplished enough to move forward and ensure that teams have spent enough time on each of the phases and don’t start modeling before the data is ready. It is a little different from the data analysis life cycle this program is based on, but it has some core ideas in common: the first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions; data has to be prepared before it can be analyzed and used; and then findings should be shared and acted on.

For more information, refer to [The Genesis of EMC's Data Analytics Lifecycle.](https://infocus.delltechnologies.com/david_dietrich/the-genesis-of-emcs-data-analytics-lifecycle/)

### SAS's iterative life cycle

An iterative life cycle was created by a company called **SAS**, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results:

1. Ask
1. Prepare
1. Explore
1. Model
1. Implement
1. Act
1. Evaluate

The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Their life cycle has seven steps, many of which we have seen in the other models, like Ask, Prepare, Model, and Act. But this life cycle is also a little different; it includes a step after the act phase designed to help analysts evaluate their solutions and potentially return to the ask phase again.

For more information, refer to [Managing the Analytics Life Cycle for Decisions at Scale.](https://www.sas.com/content/dam/SAS/en_us/doc/whitepaper1/manage-analytical-life-cycle-continuous-innovation-106179.pdf)

### Project-based data analytics life cycle

A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:

1. Identifying the problem
1. Designing data requirements
1. Pre-processing data
1. Performing data analysis
1. Visualizing data

This data analytics project life cycle was developed by Vignesh Prajapati. It doesn’t include the sixth phase, or what we have been referring to as the Act phase. However, it still covers a lot of the same steps as the life cycles we have already described. It begins with identifying the problem, preparing and processing data before analysis, and ends with data visualization.

For more information, refer to [Understanding the data analytics project life cycle.](http://pingax.com/understanding-data-analytics-project-life-cycle/)

### Big data analytics life cycle

Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, **Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques**. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
1. Data identification
1. Data acquisition and filtering
1. Data extraction
1. Data validation and cleaning 
1. Data aggregation and representation
1. Data analysis
1. Data visualization
1. Utilization of analysis results 

This life cycle appears to have three or four more steps than the previous life cycle models. But in reality, they have just broken down what we have been referring to as Prepare and Process into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data before the analysis phase.

For more information, refer to [Big Data Adoption and Planning Considerations.](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2473128&seqNum=11&ranMID=24808)

### Key takeaway

From our journey to the pyramids and data in ancient Egypt to now, the way we analyze data has evolved (and continues to do so). The data analysis process is like real life architecture, there are different ways to do things but the same core ideas still appear in each model of the process. Whether you use the structure of this Google Data Analytics Certificate or one of the many other iterations you have learned about, we are here to help guide you as you continue on your data journey.
